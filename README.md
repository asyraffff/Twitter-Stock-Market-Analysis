# Twitter stock market Analysis

Since Twitter was introduced to the stock market in 2014, the first four years have been good for Twitter. Twitter had its worst stock market years in 2016 and 2017. 2018 was the year when its stock prices rose, followed by 2019 and 2020. Next came 2021, Twitter's most successful stock market year (before Parag take the CEO role). The year 2021 marked Twitter's highest stock price ever. However, Twitter's stock price declined again in 2022.


What new things I learned from this data analysis project :

1- Improve my plotly knowledge especially on building a more customized bar chart & candlestick

2- Technic on how to add assign buttons to control time periods, which to analyze the stock prices of Twitter in different time periods. (1 month, 2 years....)

3- Use the range slider to zoom into a particular time period

4- Not all CTOs can become CEOs ðŸ«
